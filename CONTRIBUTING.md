# Contributing to Hara repositories

Start with an issue that can be understood through the GitHub connector alone.
The issue must define its outcome, scope, acceptance criteria, validation,
relationships, and delivery boundary.

Before implementation:

1. Read the owning repository `AGENTS.md` and linked specifications.
2. Confirm the issue has one owner and explicit native blockers.
3. Record any missing decision, reproduction, specification, or access need.
4. Do not mark the issue Ready until those prerequisites are resolved.

Every implementation pull request names exactly one Primary issue. Use
`Closes` only when merging the pull request completes the issue; otherwise use
an explicit `Advances` link.

See [the delivery workflow](docs/connector-first-delivery.md) for the complete
contract.
